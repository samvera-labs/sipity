module Sipity
  # A proxy for the entity that is being processed.
  # By using a proxy, we need not worry about polluting the proxy's concerns
  # with things related to processing.
  #
  # The goal is to keep this behavior separate, so that we can possibly
  # extract the information.
  # @example To get the Sipity::Entity for a work
  #   work = GenericWork.first
  #   work_global_id = work.to_global_id.to_s
  #   => "gid://whatever/GenericWork/3x816m604"
  #   Sipity::Entity.where(proxy_for_global_id: work_global_id).first
  #   => #<Sipity::Entity id: 1, proxy_for_global_id: "gid://whatever/GenericWork/3x816m604",
